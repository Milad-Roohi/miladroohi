# Abstract.
abstract = "This paper presents a methodology to estimate element‐by‐element demand‐to‐capacity ratios in instrumented steel moment‐resisting frames subject to earthquakes. The methodology combines a finite element model and acceleration measurements at various points throughout the building to estimate time history of displacements and internal force demands in all members. The estimated demands and their uncertainty are compared with code‐based capacity from which probabilistic bounds of demand‐to‐capacity ratios are obtained. The proposed methodology is verified using a simulated six‐story building and validated using acceleration data from California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program station 24370 during the Northridge and Sierra Madre earthquakes."
