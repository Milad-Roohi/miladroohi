The research in this project investigates a new framework for structural health monitoring of structures subjected to cumulative damage such as fatigue. This project deviates from the conventional approach of identifying damage as changes in model parameters. Instead, this project will investigate a novel framework that combines probabilistic damage mechanics and dynamic state estimation. A new algorithm will be developed which will be capable of optimally combining the predictive capabilities of multi-scale finite element models with that of sensor measurements to reconstruct the complete dynamic response of a structure. The reconstructed response allows assessment of the state of cumulative fatigue damage throughout the structure, thus anticipating potential damage before it reaches a critical level. Once the state of damage together with its uncertainty is determined, the condition of the structure can be projected into the future in order to perform probabilistic damage prognosis. The research involves development of computational algorithms, laboratory experiments and field validation using real data from minimally instrumented operational bridge and building structures.
